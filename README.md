# Language-C

This repository contains a collection of small C programs implementing algorithms and functionalities. These programs serve as building blocks for more complex projects.

## Final Project

The culmination of this work is the [Pokemon Project](https://github.com/anthocote19/Pokemon-Project), which integrates various algorithms developed here.

## List of Algorithms

- **Brutus**: A basic implementation.
- **Caesar Cipher**: Encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher.
- **Exchanging Two Variables**: A simple swap of two variables.
- **Power Calculation**: Computing powers of numbers.
- **Truth Tables**: Displaying truth tables for logical operations.
- **Sorting**: Implementing various sorting algorithms.
- **Morse Code**: Converting text to Morse code.

## How to Run

Clone this repository and compile the C files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthocote19/Language-C.git
cd Language-C
gcc -o output_file source_file.c
./output_file
